## üßê What's inside?

### Features

The main feature of this application is to allow users to download Facebook albums after entering the album link. When users enter a Facebook album link and click the "download" button, the application uses a tool called Puppeteer to scrape the HTML of the album and then presents these files as a downloadable ZIP file. Additionally, the application also includes a feature that warns the user if they are leaving the page while the download process may not have been completed yet.

## Structure

- `pages` - Contains top-level pages of the application.
  - `api` - Contains serverless API endpoints.
    - `download.ts` - Downloads a Facebook album using Puppeteer to scrape the HTML.
  - `index.tsx` - Renders the root component into the DOM.

The `src` directory contains the following:

- `styles` - Contains global styles.
  `global.scss` - Global SCSS stylesheet.
- `containers`
  - `Home` - Contains the main component of the application.
    - `Home.module.scss` - Local SCSS stylesheet for the Home component.
    - `Home.tsx` - Renders a form that allows users to input a Facebook album link and start downloading it.
- `Hooks`
  `index.ts` - Exports all custom hooks.
  `useBeforeUnload.ts` - Provides a hook that warns the user before leaving the page if a download is in progress.
